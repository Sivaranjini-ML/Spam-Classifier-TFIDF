# Spam-Classifier-TFIDF

A simple spam detector using Python, TF-IDF, and Naive Bayes.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project classifies SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam). It uses text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and the Naive Bayes algorithm.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/Sivaranjini-ML/Spam-Classifier-TFIDF.git

2. Install dependencies:

pip install pandas scikit-learn

3. Run the notebook using:
- Jupyter Notebook OR  
- Google Colab (recommended for beginners)

## 📊 Sample Output

Accuracy: 0.99
Prediction: ['spam']

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Use **deep learning** models like LSTM for better accuracy  
- Integrate with a web interface using Flask or Streamlit  
- Add **real-time message detection**  
- Deploy on Heroku or Render

---

## ✨ Special Notes

- This is one of my first Machine Learning projects using TF-IDF.  
- I’m actively learning and building more ML-based solutions.  
- Suggestions or contributions are welcome!
